# Learning React
---

This is an repository to store my studies about React. As I evolve, I will be updating this repository and adding more projects.
This is the projects that I have done so far:
- [x] My [Portfolio](https://github.com/frcelipe7/learning_react/tree/main/portifolio/portifolio);


To run these projects just folow these steps:
1- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2- Run the following Bash commands and wait for the installation

## Starting a project with Vite
```bash
npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react
cd my-app
npm install
```

## Download any of these projects
```bash
git clone
```

- Run the project
```bash
npm run dev
```

Vite is a tool to build and run React during development in an optimized way. It is an alternative to Create React App, which is faster and has a faster startup time.

- Install the project dependencies
```bash
=============
```

- Install prop-types
```bash
npm install prop-types
```
